    The ability to associate temporally segregated information and assign positive or
    negative valence to environmental cues is paramount for survival. Studies have shown
    that different projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are potentiated
    following reward or punishment learning1–7. However, we do not yet understand how
    valence-specific information is routed to the BLA neurons with the appropriate
    downstream projections, nor do we understand how to reconcile the sub-second
    timescales of synaptic plasticity8–11 with the longer timescales separating the
    predictive cues from their outcomes. Here we demonstrate that neurotensin
    (NT)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT)
    projecting to the BLA (PVT-BLA:NT) mediate valence assignment by exerting NT
    concentration-dependent modulation in BLA during associative learning.
    We found that optogenetic activation of the PVT-BLA:NT projection promotes reward
    learning, whereas PVT-BLA projection-specific knockout of the NT gene (Nts) augments
    punishment learning. Using genetically encoded calcium and NT sensors, we further
    revealed that both calcium dynamics within the PVT-BLA:NT projection and NT
    concentrations in the BLA are enhanced after reward learning and reduced after
    punishment learning. Finally, we showed that CRISPR-mediated knockout of the Nts
    gene in the PVT-BLA pathway blunts BLA neural dynamics and attenuates the preference
    for active behavioural strategies to reward and punishment predictive cues. In sum,
    we have identified NT as a neuropeptide that signals valence in the BLA, and showed
    that NT is a critical neuromodulator that orchestrates positive and negative valence
    assignment in amygdala neurons by extending valence-specific plasticity to
    behaviourally relevant timescales.
